# Project Overview

While most members of our hackathon committee had attended many hackathons, none of us had organized a hackathon before.  Thus, we had an enormous amount of planning and preparation for such a small team.  Based on my previous experience with hackathons, I heavily promoted the value of a central hub for communication and resources for which I shows other hackathons' live sites as examples.  Eventually we decided that I'd be the one to create and setup the live site.

# The Challenge

We had to determine what requirements our live site would have.  Our ultimate goal was to have a central backend with an account system for registration, submissions, etc. but given the time constraints we were under, we reduced the scope of the project.

# The Approach & Solution

We used other platforms for registration and submissions but made our own platform to provide relevant resources.  

I scoured the internet for other hackathon live sites and compiled what I felt were the best features among them before creating live.phoenixhacks.com using create-react-app as a boilerplate.

# The Results

The website fulfilled its purpose quite well.  The only unresolved issue from this project is some kind of memory leak which would cause the page to freeze after a long period of time.  For future projects of this nature, I plan to implement a means for users to provide feedback.

Another important consideration throughout this project was that it would be a foundation upon which future students can improve and consolidate our own central platform that has all of our desired features.
